                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p class="description">My name is Yauheniya Viarbiczkaya. I am 20. I am a student. I study at BNTU. My specialty is Transport logistics. About a year ago I understood that I don't like this profession at all, that’s why I deсided to took the path of self-education.
                    <br> Because I did not know exactly what I wanna do in my life, I started looking. First of all I tried web marketing, cos this field is close to my economic education and it is morden and perspective at the same time. A couple of
                    lectures from different talented guys helped me realize that I want to be on the other side - I want to create something, not promote. And from web marketing I mooved to web development. <br> Logistics is about optimization, so I made
                    a plan. It included courses, lectures, video tutorials. And certain period of time it worked. Now it's not enough. I need to transfer my efforts to offline.</p>

                    <p>I believe that the global goal of my life is to become a full member of society. It means becoming successful in both a career and personal relationship. I can not wait to finish university (which at the moment only hinders) to start
                        working. It seems funny - who wants to work? I want. I'm sick of wasting my time. I have enough energy to learn something new, absorb a lot of information and work hard. Over the past month I have had to learn so much absolutely
                        new that at some points it seemed that my brain would explode. But I think it's all worth it. I want to develop in IT further, improving my skills and abilities.

                            <p>I started with html-academy courses. <br> They gave me basic theoretical knowledge and skills.</p>

                            <p>Then I wondered how everything works in practice. So I trained for a long time on video tutorials on YouTube</p>

                            <p>During the process of trainings, I realized that my theoretical knowledge was either not endorsed, or had already been forgotten. So I took some courses at codecademy to refresh and generalize my knowledge.</p>

                            <p>And the last but certainly not the least - RSShool courses. When I started, I had no knowledge of either the JS or the basics of OOP. Of course, now I still cannot call my knowledge complete. But the RSSchool could give me
